# FolderPlayer_mod2 (J2ME)
Audio player for Nokia S40 etc. phones (J2ME MIDlet)

source partly from http://folderplayer.com/j2me/, thanks!
(it's an unofficial mod!)

Notable features: 
- recursively plays folders without making playlists (as original one) 
- bookmarks (continue listening where you stopped last time)
- list of favourite tracks
- sleep timer
- delete playing file
- barebones, no gimmicks = battery friendly  
- v1.2.0 adds support for playing all filetypes the user's device is able to play

Know issues:
- 'while playing' screen sometimes blanks or misses elements (can trigger a redraw by e.g. changing volume etc.)
